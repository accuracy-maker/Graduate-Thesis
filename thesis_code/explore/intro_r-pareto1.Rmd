## Generate simulated data points
```{r}
set.seed(123)

# Simulate 100 samples of 3D unit Pareto margins
n <- 100
X <- matrix(rexp(n * 3, rate = 1), ncol = 3)  # exponential(1) has Pareto(1) tail

```

plot the generated points
```{r}
# Load the library
library(scatterplot3d)

# Plot the 3D Pareto-like points
s3d <- scatterplot3d(X, color = "blue", pch = 16,
                     xlab = "X1", ylab = "X2", zlab = "X3",
                     main = "L1-thresholded Extreme Points")
```
## define L1-norm function
```{r}
r_L1 <- function(x) rowSums(x) 
```

## perform threshold
```{r}
u <- 5  # threshold
Z <- X[r_L1(X) > u, ]  # this is the r-Pareto sample with L1 functional
```

mark the Z as red points
```{r}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(X, color = "blue", pch = 16,
                     xlab = "X1", ylab = "X2", zlab = "X3",
                     main = "L1-thresholded Extreme Points")
s3d$points3d(Z, col = "red", pch = 16)
```

## Normalize data onto r-Pareto sphere
```{r}
Z_normalized <- Z / r_L1(Z)
```

Now every row of Z_normalized satisfies $\sum{x_i} = 1$. These are points on the Pareto sphere defined by the L1-norm.

```{r}
s3d <- scatterplot3d(Z_normalized, color = "blue", pch = 16,
                     xlab = "X1", ylab = "X2", zlab = "X3",
                     main = "L1 r-Pareto Sphere with Plane x+y+z=1")

# Step 3: draw the plane x + y + z = 1 (z = 1 - x - y)
# We'll create a triangle (x, y) such that x + y <= 1
x_vals <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 20)
y_vals <- seq(0, 1, length.out = 20)

# Get only points where x + y <= 1 (to stay within valid region)
grid <- expand.grid(x = x_vals, y = y_vals)
grid <- subset(grid, x + y <= 1)
grid$z <- 1 - grid$x - grid$y

# Convert to 2D projection using s3d$xyz.convert
proj <- s3d$xyz.convert(grid$x, grid$y, grid$z)

# Draw the plane as a transparent polygon mesh
polygon(proj$x, proj$y, col = rgb(1, 0, 0, 0.2), border = NA)
```
